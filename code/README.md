# What is this

My third React project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a Trump free Twitter**.

## How I started

I started a bit too fast with this project, I was so excited that I didn't read the project guide properly. I did the styling for the display-thoughts and send-thought containers and then I displayed the posts that where already in the API. Since I didn't read the guide properly I had som issues after that. But another member in the group I'm in told me about the hint section and it was very helpful and I could carry on. 

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

As mentioned I struggled when it was time to  first with not knowing how to create posts, but after I had read the guide thoroughly I understood how to continue with the project. That was my main issue during this week, so a minor one to be honest. 

### What I'm proud of

I'd say that this week is another week with really nice code structure that I'm proud of. I'm also proud that I used SASS during this week. I have watched a few videos about SASS and thought it would be a nice idea to try it out and I loved it.  haven't deep dived into all of it but have enjoyed all things I tried with it so far. 

I'm also pretty proud with my deep dive solutions, I didn't do all of them, but I did manage to figure out two at least. 

## If I had more time

If I hade more time I would have done the remaining two deep dives.
